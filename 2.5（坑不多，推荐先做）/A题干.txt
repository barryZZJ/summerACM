A. Six Degrees of Cowvin Bacon

一起做过电影的连一条边距离为1，没有做过电影的距离为两点间最小距离。求所有牛里到其他牛的平均距离的最小值*100

The cows have been making movies lately, so they are ready to play a variant of the famous game "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon". 

The game works like this: each cow is considered to be zero degrees of separation (degrees) away from herself. If two distinct cows have been in a movie together, each is considered to be one 'degree' away from the other. If a two cows have never worked together but have both worked with a third cow, they are considered to be two 'degrees' away from each other (counted as: one degree to the cow they've worked with and one more to the other cow). This scales to the general case. 

The N (2 <= N <= 300) cows are interested in figuring out which cow has the smallest average degree of separation from all the other cows. excluding herself of course. The cows have made M (1 <= M <= 10000) movies and it is guaranteed that some relationship path exists between every pair of cows. 
Input
* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and M 

* Lines 2..M+1: Each input line contains a set of two or more space-separated integers that describes the cows appearing in a single movie. The first integer is the number of cows participating in the described movie, (e.g., Mi); the subsequent Mi integers tell which cows were. 
Output
* Line 1: A single integer that is 100 times the shortest mean degree of separation of any of the cows. 
Sample Input
4 2
3 1 2 3
2 3 4
Sample Output
100
Hint
[Cow 3 has worked with all the other cows and thus has degrees of separation: 1, 1, and 1 -- a mean of 1.00 .]
