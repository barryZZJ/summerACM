B. Sumsets

Farmer John commanded his cows to search for different sets of numbers that sum to a given number. The cows use only numbers that are an integer power of 2. Here are the possible sets of numbers that sum to 7: 

1) 1+1+1+1+1+1+1 
2) 1+1+1+1+1+2 
3) 1+1+1+2+2 
4) 1+1+1+4 
5) 1+2+2+2 
6) 1+2+4 

Help FJ count all possible representations for a given integer N (1 <= N <= 1,000,000). 
Input
A single line with a single integer, N.
Output
The number of ways to represent N as the indicated sum. Due to the potential huge size of this number, print only last 9 digits (in base 10 representation).
Sample Input
7
Sample Output
6
